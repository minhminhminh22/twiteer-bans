# twitter-bans

The goal of my project is to analyze twitter reactions after the decision on Roe v. Wade, specifically whether the banned tweets mention about the Supreme Court, and how many retweets are they getting before getting flagged down.

Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection: I am only pooling data from banned tweets from 24-06-2022 to 1-07-2022. My results only reflect the reactions of the people within that time stamp, and only from the known banned tweets. Further research must be conducted before any reliable conclusion is inferred.
